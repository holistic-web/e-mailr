# e-mailr
An app to send analogue messages, digitally!

https://e-mailr.web.app
https://e-mailr-dev.web.app

It depends on:
- firebase project "e-mailr"
- some form of letter provider (TBD)
- some form of payment processor (TBD)

It is made up of the following components:

## web-app
This project uses a react progressive web app for the front-end. It is still a work in progress but can be found in the `/web-app` folder.

## cloud-functions
These will connect with 3rd party apis. It is not yet implemented.
