## Configuration
Our account is set up under the company name "Holistic Web" and has the following users set up:

## Usage
We will use Stannp in our cloud function to send letters. The Stannp API allows for sending a letter simply by providing text content and an address, but PDFs, basic HTML, and images are also supported. _A referrence to our current implementation will go here once it's complete._
